# ScrapMechanicWorldViewer
This tool was made to view ScrapMechanic world files.

This tool uses LWJGL 3.

<b>NOTE: Because this tool is still under construction trying it out might be hard to run this and will probably result in errors.</b>

This is a try to create a independant sqlite library for scrap mechanic with a render implemented.


## Features
* The viewer can display survival worlds and knows how to load tile files
* Prefabs can now be loaded into the viewer

## Progression
Adding diffuse lighting, fixing minor color issues and loading blueprints is currently being worked on.
